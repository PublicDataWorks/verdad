You will be provided with a list of audio segments from a larger audio file. Please transcribe each segment carefully and return a JSON object following the specified schema.
It is critical that you transcribe each segment independently, without considering the content of other segments. Each transcript should be solely based on the audio within its corresponding segment.

Here is the JSON schema for the output:

```json
{
    "segments": [
        {
            "segment": 1,
            "transcript": "..."
        },
        {
            "segment": 2,
            "transcript": "..."
        }
        // ...transcripts of additional segments
    ]
}
```

Additional Notes:

-   Thoroughly review each segmentâ€™s transcript for completeness and accuracy before finalizing it.
-   Check for grammatical errors and misheard words to ensure that the transcripts are accurate.
-   If certain parts of the audio are unclear or inaudible, indicate this in the transcript using placeholders such as [inaudible], [unclear], [noise], [music], etc.
-   It is possible that the audio contains multiple languages mixed together.

Important Notes:

-   Transcribe each segment independently, without considering the content of other segments.
-   Ensure that the segment_number for each transcript in the JSON output matches the corresponding audio segment you are transcribing. Double-check that the segment numbers are accurate and sequential.

Now proceed to transcribe the provided audio segments.
