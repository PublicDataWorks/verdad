You will be provided with a list of audio segments from a larger audio file. Please transcribe each segment carefully and return a JSON object following the specified schema.
It is critical that you transcribe each segment independently, without considering the content of other segments. Each transcription should be solely based on the audio within its corresponding segment.

Here is the JSON schema for the output:

```json
{
    "segments": [
        {
            "segment": 1,
            "transcription": "..."
        },
        {
            "segment": 2,
            "transcription": "..."
        }
        // ...transcriptions of additional segments
    ]
}
```

Please proceed to transcribe the provided audio segments.
