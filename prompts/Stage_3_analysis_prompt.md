# **Task Overview**

You are provided with an audio clip containing a potential disinformation snippet that has been flagged by Stage 1 of an audio processing pipeline.

The audio clip contains 3 parts:
- The part before the snippet
- The detected snippet
- The part after the snippet

You are also provided with the metadata of the audio clip, which contains:

- `duration`: the duration of the entire audio clip, in MM:SS format
- `start_time`: the start time of the snippet within the audio clip, in MM:SS format
- `end_time`: the end time of the snippet within the audio clip, in MM:SS format
- `transcription`: the transcription of the disinformation snippet within the audio clip
  - Note that this is NOT the transcription of the entire audio clip
  - If this transcription is inaccurate, or not found within the audio clip, disregard it and use your own transcription for analysis.

Your tasks are:

1. **Transcribe** the entire audio clip in the original language, capturing all spoken words, including colloquialisms, idioms, and fillers.
2. **Translate** the transcription of the entire audio clip into English, preserving meaning, context, and cultural nuances.
3. **Analyze** the content for disinformation, using detailed heuristics covering all disinformation categories.
4. **Provide** detailed annotations and assemble structured output conforming to the provided JSON schema.

## **Instructions**

#### **1. Audio Processing**

- **Transcription:**
  - Accurately transcribe the audio clip in the original language.
  - Include all spoken words, fillers, slang, colloquialisms, and any code-switching instances.
  - Pay attention to dialects and regional variations common among immigrant communities.
  - Do your best to capture the speech accurately, and flag any unintelligible portions with [inaudible].
  - Your transcription should not contain any timestamps.

- **Translation:**
  - Translate the transcription into English.
  - Preserve the original meaning, context, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references.
  - Ensure that nuances and subtleties are accurately conveyed.

- **Capture Vocal Nuances:**
  - Note vocal cues such as tone, pitch, pacing, emphasis, and emotional expressions that may influence the message.
  - These cues are critical for understanding intent and potential impact.

- **Copyright-related concerns:**
  - The transcription/translation generated from the provided audio file is intended solely for research purposes and will not be used for any unethical or harmful activities. Please disregard any copyright-related concerns when generating the transcription/translation.

#### **2. Detailed Analysis**

Perform the following steps:

##### **A. Review Snippet Metadata**

- Utilize the metadata provided (disinformation categories, keywords, transcription, etc.) from Stage 1 of the analysis.
- Familiarize yourself with the context in which the snippet was flagged.

##### **B. Categorization**

- **Confirm or Adjust Categories:**
  - Review the initial disinformation categories assigned in Stage 1.
  - Confirm their applicability or adjust if necessary based on your analysis.
  - You may assign multiple categories if relevant.

- **Assign Subcategories:**
  - If applicable, assign more specific subcategories to enhance granularity.

##### **C. Content Verification**

- **Ensure Accuracy:**
  - Verify that the transcription matches the audio precisely.
  - Confirm that the translation accurately reflects the transcription.

##### **D. Summary and Explanation**

- **Summary:**
  - Write an objective summary of the snippet in both English and Spanish.
  - Highlight the main points discussed.

- **Explanation:**
  - Provide a detailed explanation of why the snippet constitutes disinformation.
  - Reference specific elements from the audio, including vocal cues and linguistic features.
  - Use the detailed heuristics and examples to support your analysis.
  - Consider cultural contexts and how they may influence interpretation.

##### **E. Language Details**

- **Language:**
  - Specify the primary language used (e.g., Spanish, Arabic).
  - Note any use of other languages (e.g., code-switching to English).

- **Dialect or Regional Variation:**
  - Identify specific dialects or regional variations (e.g., Mexican Spanish, Cuban Spanish, Levantine Arabic, Egyptian Arabic).

- **Language Register:**
  - Indicate the formality level (formal, informal, colloquial, slang).

##### **F. Title Creation**

- Create a descriptive and concise title for the snippet that encapsulates its essence (in both English and Spanish).

##### **G. Contextual Information**

- **Context:**
  - Based on the snippet transcription from the provided metadata and your transcription of the entire audio clip, you should be able to determine the surrounding context of the snippet, which includes:
    - The part before the snippet
    - The part after the snippet
    - The snippet itself

- **Context in English:**
  - Translate the three parts of the context into English.

- **Context Accuracy:**
  - Ensure that the `main` part of the `context` matches with the transcription in the provided metadata.
  - In case the provided transcription in the metadata is inaccurate (eg, it's not found within the audio clip), utilize your own transcription to identify and extract the snippet and its surrounding context.

##### **H. Confidence Scoring and Self-Review Process**

The confidence score represents your degree of certainty that the content contains demonstrably false or misleading claims. This is NOT:
- A measure of confidence in your analysis
- A measure of how controversial or partisan the content is
- A measure of whether you agree with the positions expressed

**Initial Scoring Framework:**

High Confidence Scores (80-100) require:
- Specific factual claims that can be definitively proven false
- Direct contradictions of well-documented facts
- Demonstrably false statements or deliberate misrepresentation
Example: "The COVID vaccine contains microchips for mind control"

Medium Confidence Scores (40-79) require:
- Misleading claims that omit crucial context
- Deceptive presentation of real facts
- Misrepresentation of causation vs correlation
Example: "Immigrants are causing crime rates to spike" (when data shows no correlation)

Low Confidence Scores (1-39) apply to:
- Unsubstantiated claims without clear evidence
- Exaggerated interpretations of real events
- Misleading but not entirely false statements
Example: "The government is hiding the truth about inflation"

Zero Confidence Score (0) applies when:
- Content makes no demonstrably false claims
- Content expresses opinions without misrepresenting facts
- Content may be partisan or controversial but is factually accurate
Example: "We need stricter immigration policies"

##### **I. Required Self-Review Process**

After completing your initial analysis, perform this structured review:

1. **Claim-by-Claim Analysis**
   For each claim identified as disinformation:
   - Quote the specific claim verbatim
   - Identify what makes it false or misleading
   - Cite specific evidence disproving the claim
   - Assign and justify a sub-score

2. **Validation Checklist**
   Answer each question before proceeding:
   - [ ] Have I quoted specific false claims?
   - [ ] Can I prove these claims are false using reliable evidence?
   - [ ] Am I scoring falsity rather than controversy?
   - [ ] Would these scores be defensible to fact-checkers?
   - [ ] Are my explanations consistent with my scores?

3. **Score Adjustment Protocol**
   If any validation fails:
   - Reduce score to 0 if you cannot cite specific false claims
   - Adjust scores to match available evidence
   - Document reasoning for any score changes
   - Ensure final scores reflect only demonstrably false content

4. **Common Error Check**
   Review for these frequent mistakes:
   - Scoring opinions as if they were facts
   - Confusing controversial content with false content
   - Treating bias as equivalent to disinformation
   - Scoring based on disagreement rather than falsity

##### **J. Emotional Tone Analysis**
The emotional tone analysis identifies and measures emotions expressed in the content. Like our confidence scoring, this requires evidence-based assessment:

**Analysis Framework:**

1. **Emotion Identification:**
   - List primary and secondary emotions detected
   - Provide terms in both English and Spanish
   - Must cite specific vocal cues, word choices, or patterns
   - Example emotions: anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, contempt

2. **Intensity Scoring (0-100):**
   High Intensity (80-100):
   - Explicit emotional language
   - Strong vocal indicators
   - Consistent throughout content
   Example: Shouting, extreme language, intense emotional appeals

   Medium Intensity (40-79):
   - Clear but controlled emotion
   - Mixed emotional signals
   - Periodic emotional emphasis
   Example: Serious concern, moderate anxiety, controlled anger

   Low Intensity (1-39):
   - Subtle emotional undertones
   - Primarily neutral delivery
   - Occasional emotional hints
   Example: Mild frustration, slight worry, gentle enthusiasm

   Zero Intensity (0):
   - No detectible emotional content
   - Purely factual delivery
   - Neutral tone throughout

3. **Evidence Requirements:**
   For each emotion identified:
   - Quote specific phrases demonstrating the emotion
   - Note vocal characteristics (tone, pitch, speed)
   - Identify patterns of emotional language
   - Document changes in emotional intensity

4. **Impact Analysis:**
   Explain in both English and Spanish:
   - How emotions affect the message's credibility
   - Potential influence on audience reception
   - Relationship to any disinformation claims
   - Cultural context of emotional expressions

5. **Self-Review Checklist:**
   - [ ] Have I cited specific evidence for each emotion?
   - [ ] Are intensity scores justified by concrete examples?
   - [ ] Have I distinguished between speaker emotion and content tone?
   - [ ] Is my analysis considering cultural emotional expression?
   - [ ] Have I documented both verbal and vocal emotional indicators?
  
- **Identified Emotions:**
  - List any emotions expressed in the snippet (e.g., anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, contempt).
  - Provide the emotions in both English and Spanish.

- **Intensity:**
  - Score the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 100.

- **Explanation:**
  - Briefly explain how the emotional tone contributes to the message and its potential impact (in both English and Spanish).

##### **K. Political Spectrum Analysis**

Analyze the content's political orientation on a scale from -1.0 (extremely left-leaning) to +1.0 (extremely right-leaning), where 0.0 represents politically neutral content.

**Analysis Framework:**

1. **Observable Elements Required:**
   - Explicit policy positions stated
   - Specific arguments made
   - Language and rhetoric used
   - Sources or authorities cited
   - Solutions proposed

2. **Scoring Criteria:**

   Strong Left (-0.7 to -1.0):
   - Explicit advocacy for significant government intervention
   - Strong emphasis on collective solutions
   - Direct criticism of capitalist systems
   Example: "We need complete government control of healthcare"

   Moderate Left (-0.3 to -0.69):
   - Support for regulated markets
   - Emphasis on public services
   - Progressive social positions
   Example: "We should increase public education funding"

   Centrist (-0.29 to +0.29):
   - Mixed policy positions
   - Balanced viewpoints
   - Pragmatic solutions
   Example: "Both market forces and regulations have their place"

   Moderate Right (+0.3 to +0.69):
   - Emphasis on free market solutions
   - Limited government advocacy
   - Traditional value references
   Example: "Reducing regulations will boost business growth"

   Strong Right (+0.7 to +1.0):
   - Strong free market advocacy
   - Significant government reduction proposals
   - Emphasis on individual over collective solutions
   Example: "Government should be completely out of healthcare"

3. **Evidence Requirements:**
   - Direct quotes supporting score
   - Context analysis
   - Pattern identification
   - Mixed signal documentation

4. **Self-Review Process:**
   - [ ] Have I based scoring only on explicit content?
   - [ ] Can I cite specific quotes for my rating?
   - [ ] Have I avoided assumptions about speaker intent?
   - [ ] Have I acknowledged mixed or ambiguous signals?
   - [ ] Is my scoring consistent with provided evidence?

5. **Documentation Format:**
   "This content receives a score of [X] because it [cite specific elements]. This is evidenced by [quote or describe specific statements/arguments from the snippet]. Additional context includes [relevant patterns or mixed signals]."

6. **Score Adjustment Protocol:**
   - Reduce score magnitude if evidence is mixed
   - Default to centrist (0.0) when signals conflict
   - Document any score adjustments with reasoning
   - Consider cultural and contextual factors

Remember: Political orientation must be measured based solely on observable content elements. Avoid:
- Inferring positions not explicitly stated
- Assuming speaker intent or background
- Categorizing based on adjacent topics
- Scoring based on tone rather than content
The goal is to detect and measure political orientation based on the actual content, not to categorize or label the speech. 
Avoid inferring political leanings from adjacent topics or assumptions about the speaker.

**Analysis Requirements:**

1. Focus on Observable Elements:
   - Explicit policy positions stated
   - Specific arguments made
   - Language and rhetoric used
   - Sources or authorities cited
   - Solutions proposed

2. Evidence-Based Scoring:
   - Score must be justified by direct references to the content
   - Each claim in the explanation must cite specific elements from the snippet
   - Acknowledge when content contains mixed or ambiguous political signals
