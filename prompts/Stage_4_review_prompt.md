### **Your Tasks**

1. **Primary Analysis:**

    - **Review the provided analysis** in the **Analysis JSON**.
    - Base your review **on the provided Transcription input and the Audio Metadata**.

2. **Accuracy Determination:**

    - **Determine the accuracy** of each component of the analysis.
    - Identify any discrepancies or inaccuracies.

3. **Verification:**

    - **Utilize the grounded results from internet searches** to verify claims as needed.
    - Cross-reference with up-to-date news and factual data.
    - Ensure external sources are relevant and support the Transcription.

4. **Content Adjustment:**

    - **Modify the content** within the Analysis JSON fields based on your findings.
    - Ensure all updates are justified by and consistent with the Transcription and Metadata.

5. **Output Generation:**

    - **Produce a new JSON object** that **exactly mirrors the structure** of the input Analysis JSON.
    - **Do not add or remove any fields**; only update the content within existing fields.

### **Guidelines**

-   **Primacy of Transcription and Metadata:**

    -   The **Transcription** is the most important input.
    -   All analysis and updates must be consistent with and directly supported by the Transcription and Audio Metadata.
    -   Give particular focus to the **Disinformation Snippet**, as it is the segment of the Transcription identified as containing disinformation.
      -   Ensure that the **Disinformation Snippet** is included in the Transcription.
          -   Note that the snippet may not perfectly match the transcription; minor discrepancies are acceptable as long as the core content is present.
      -   If the snippet cannot be located in the Transcription:
          -   Set the **confidence_scores.overall** to 0.
          -   Write a clear explanation in the **confidence_scores.analysis.score_adjustments.adjustment_reason** field, indicating that the snippet is missing from the Transcription.
          -   Leave all other fields in the Analysis JSON unchanged.

-   **Comprehensive Review:**

    -   Examine all components of the Analysis JSON.
    -   Evaluate the accuracy and validity of each field.

-   **Evidence-Based Adjustments:**

    -   Update text fields (e.g., `summary`, `explanation`, `evidence`) to accurately reflect the Transcription.
    -   Adjust numerical scores (e.g., `confidence_scores`, `political_leaning.score`):
        -   Provide justifications in the corresponding `explanation` or `reasoning` fields.
        -   Ensure scores are appropriate given the Transcription, Metadata, and the scoring guidelines provided.
    -   Modify array elements as needed:
        -   Add or update `claims` under `confidence_scores.analysis`.

-   **Content Preservation:**

    - If, upon review, a section of the Analysis JSON is deemed accurate and well-written, it should be kept unchanged. There is no need to rephrase or modify content that is already sufficient.
    - Only change the content when you are confident in your assessment. If you are unsure about a change, keep the original content as is.

-   **Objectivity and Neutrality:**

    -   Maintain strict neutrality throughout your analysis.
    -   Focus on verifiable facts from the Transcription, external sources, and Metadata.
    -   Distinguish between controversial content and demonstrably false claims.

-   **Output Requirements:**

    -   **Structure Fidelity:** The output JSON structure must be **identical** to the input Analysis JSON structure.
        -   Do not add, remove, or rearrange any fields.
    -   **Content Updates:** Only update the content within the existing fields.
    -   **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure your revised analysis is clear, concise, and easily understandable.


### **Confidence Scoring and Self-Review Process**

The confidence score represents your degree of certainty that the content contains demonstrably false or misleading claims. This is NOT:
- A measure of confidence in your analysis
- A measure of how controversial or partisan the content is
- A measure of whether you agree with the positions expressed

**Initial Scoring Framework:**

High Confidence Scores (80-100) require:
- Specific factual claims that can be definitively proven false
- Direct contradictions of well-documented facts
- Demonstrably false statements or deliberate misrepresentation
Example: "The COVID vaccine contains microchips for mind control"

Medium Confidence Scores (40-79) require:
- Misleading claims that omit crucial context
- Deceptive presentation of real facts
- Misrepresentation of causation vs correlation
Example: "Immigrants are causing crime rates to spike" (when data shows no correlation)

Low Confidence Scores (1-39) apply to:
- Unsubstantiated claims without clear evidence
- Exaggerated interpretations of real events
- Misleading but not entirely false statements
Example: "The government is hiding the truth about inflation"

Zero Confidence Score (0) applies when:
- Content makes no demonstrably false claims
- Content expresses opinions without misrepresenting facts
- Content may be partisan or controversial but is factually accurate
Example: "We need stricter immigration policies"

### **Required Self-Review Process**

After completing your initial analysis, perform this structured review:

1. **Claim-by-Claim Analysis**
   For each claim identified as disinformation:
   - Quote the specific claim verbatim
   - Identify what makes it false or misleading
   - Cite specific evidence disproving the claim
   - Assign and justify a sub-score

2. **Validation Checklist**
   Answer each question before proceeding:
   - [ ] Have I quoted specific false claims?
   - [ ] Can I prove these claims are false using reliable evidence?
   - [ ] Am I scoring falsity rather than controversy?
   - [ ] Would these scores be defensible to fact-checkers?
   - [ ] Are my explanations consistent with my scores?

3. **Score Adjustment Protocol**
   If any validation fails:
   - Reduce score to 0 if you cannot cite specific false claims
   - Adjust scores to match available evidence
   - Document reasoning for any score changes
   - Ensure final scores reflect only demonstrably false content

4. **Common Error Check**
   Review for these frequent mistakes:
   - Scoring opinions as if they were facts
   - Confusing controversial content with false content
   - Treating bias as equivalent to disinformation
   - Scoring based on disagreement rather than falsity

### **Political Spectrum Analysis**

Analyze the content's political orientation on a scale from -1.0 (extremely left-leaning) to +1.0 (extremely right-leaning), where 0.0 represents politically neutral content.

**Analysis Framework:**

1. **Observable Elements Required:**
   - Explicit policy positions stated
   - Specific arguments made
   - Language and rhetoric used
   - Sources or authorities cited
   - Solutions proposed

2. **Scoring Criteria:**

   Strong Left (-0.7 to -1.0):
   - Explicit advocacy for significant government intervention
   - Strong emphasis on collective solutions
   - Direct criticism of capitalist systems
   Example: "We need complete government control of healthcare"

   Moderate Left (-0.3 to -0.69):
   - Support for regulated markets
   - Emphasis on public services
   - Progressive social positions
   Example: "We should increase public education funding"

   Centrist (-0.29 to +0.29):
   - Mixed policy positions
   - Balanced viewpoints
   - Pragmatic solutions
   Example: "Both market forces and regulations have their place"

   Moderate Right (+0.3 to +0.69):
   - Emphasis on free market solutions
   - Limited government advocacy
   - Traditional value references
   Example: "Reducing regulations will boost business growth"

   Strong Right (+0.7 to +1.0):
   - Strong free market advocacy
   - Significant government reduction proposals
   - Emphasis on individual over collective solutions
   Example: "Government should be completely out of healthcare"

3. **Evidence Requirements:**
   - Direct quotes supporting score
   - Context analysis
   - Pattern identification
   - Mixed signal documentation

4. **Self-Review Process:**
   - [ ] Have I based scoring only on explicit content?
   - [ ] Can I cite specific quotes for my rating?
   - [ ] Have I avoided assumptions about speaker intent?
   - [ ] Have I acknowledged mixed or ambiguous signals?
   - [ ] Is my scoring consistent with provided evidence?

5. **Documentation Format:**
   "This content receives a score of [X] because it [cite specific elements]. This is evidenced by [quote or describe specific statements/arguments from the transcription]. Additional context includes [relevant patterns or mixed signals]."

6. **Score Adjustment Protocol:**
   - Reduce score magnitude if evidence is mixed
   - Default to centrist (0.0) when signals conflict
   - Document any score adjustments with reasoning
   - Consider cultural and contextual factors

Remember: Political orientation must be measured based solely on observable content elements. Avoid:
- Inferring positions not explicitly stated
- Assuming speaker intent or background
- Categorizing based on adjacent topics
- Scoring based on tone rather than content
The goal is to detect and measure political orientation based on the actual content, not to categorize or label the speech. 
Avoid inferring political leanings from adjacent topics or assumptions about the speaker.

**Analysis Requirements:**

1. Focus on Observable Elements:
   - Explicit policy positions stated
   - Specific arguments made
   - Language and rhetoric used
   - Sources or authorities cited
   - Solutions proposed

2. Evidence-Based Scoring:
   - Score must be justified by direct references to the content
   - Each claim in the explanation must cite specific elements from the transcription
   - Acknowledge when content contains mixed or ambiguous political signals
