Process:

* Utilize Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM with dynamic heuristics to scan audio

Output:
For each flagged snippet:

* Unique Snippet ID (UUID)
* Start Time and End Time
* Brief description
* Applicable disinformation categories
* Detected keywords

Action:

* Insert snippet metadata into the database

Intermediary Stage: Audio Clipping

Input:

* Original full audio file
* Timestamps from Stage 1

Process:
For each flagged snippet:

* Extract audio segment corresponding to Start and End Time
* Include a few seconds before and after for context
* Save as separate audio file

Output:

* Individual audio files for each snippet (e.g., snippet_<SnippetID>.mp3)

Action:

* Update database entry with path to audio clip file

LLM Stage 2: In-Depth Analysis

Input:

* Audio clips of flagged snippets
* Snippet metadata from database
* Disinformation topics and elaborations

Process:

* Utilize Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM for detailed analysis:
* Confirm or refine disinformation categories
* Provide detailed explanation for flagging
* Analyze tone, emotion, and emphasis
* Assign confidence scores
* Conduct emotional tone analysis
* Transcribe audio clip in original language
* Translate transcription into English

Output:

* Detailed annotations for each snippet (conforming to preset JSON schema)

Action:

* Update database entries with detailed analysis, transcriptions, and translations

Iterative Refinement Process

User feedback collection:

* Labels applied by users
* Upvotes on existing labels
* Free-form comments

Periodic review by advanced LLM:

* Process accumulated user feedback
* Review individual snippets and associated discussions
* Propose adjustments to dynamic heuristics used in Stages 1 and 2

Final review by another LLM:

* Evaluate proposed changes to heuristics in the system instructions
* Write a plan for revising the system message based on this assessment 
* If approved by human reviewer, execute the plan

Implementation of approved changes to prompt heuristics

* Rewrite the prompt and update the new version in the database
* Store an explanation of changes an additional field in the database
* Deprecate/archive the old version in the database

Database Interactions

DB Interactions During Stages 1 and 2

* Snippet ID Generation: During Stage 1, when a snippet is first identified
* Data Storage:
    * Stage 1: Insert basic snippet metadata
    * Intermediary Stage: Update with audio clip path/URL
    * Stage 2: Update with detailed analysis, transcriptions, and translations

DB Interactions During Iterative Refinement Process

* Store current and historical versions of prompts used in Stages 1 and 2
* Each prompt version includes:
    * Unique version ID
    * Explanation of changes from the previous version
    * Record or summary of the specific user feedback that informed these changes
    * ID of the previous version that this new version was based on
    * Full prompt text
    * Timestamp of implementation
    * Timestamp and username of human reviewer who approved it
    * Associated LLM model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro)

Version History

* Stage 2: Reduces false positives by applying detailed heuristics to verify and contextualize flagged snippets.
* Cultural Sensitivity Balance:
* Stage 1: Balances cultural sensitivity with the need for simplicity, including essential cultural elements without overcomplicating heuristics.
* Stage 2: Provides extensive cultural context, essential for accurately interpreting and analyzing disinformation within specific communities.




9. Practical Considerations

* Processing Large Data Sets:
* Stage 1: Needs to process thousands of hours of audio efficiently, so heuristics must be manageable for a smaller LLM.
* Stage 2: Deals with fewer snippets (those flagged by Stage 1), allowing for more time-intensive analysis.
* LLM Capability Alignment:
* Stage 1 Heuristics: Tailored to the limitations of a smaller LLM, avoiding overloading it with complexity.
* Stage 2 Heuristics: Designed to leverage the advanced capabilities of a larger LLM.




10. Summary

The heuristics differ between the Stage 1 and Stage 2 prompts to align with the specific roles, capabilities, and objectives of each LLM stage:


* Stage 1:
* Role: Initial screening to identify potential disinformation.
* Heuristics: Simplified for quick application; focus on key indicators.
* LLM: Smaller, less computationally intensive model.
* Objective: High recall, ensuring minimal disinformation is missed.
* Stage 2:
* Role: In-depth analysis of flagged snippets.
* Heuristics: Detailed and nuanced to allow thorough examination.
* LLM: Larger, more sophisticated model capable of complex analysis.
* Objective: High precision, accurately confirming disinformation and reducing false positives.




Conclusion

The differences in the heuristics between the Stage 1 and Stage 2 prompts are deliberate and essential for the system's overall effectiveness. By tailoring the heuristics to the capabilities and purposes of each LLM stage, we ensure that:


* Stage 1 efficiently filters vast amounts of audio content, identifying potential disinformation without overburdening the LLM.
* Stage 2 thoroughly analyzes the identified snippets, leveraging detailed heuristics to provide accurate, culturally sensitive insights.

This division of labor maximizes both efficiency and accuracy, enabling the system to handle large-scale disinformation detection while maintaining a high standard of analysis.
